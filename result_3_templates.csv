Hi Nisha,

I hope this message finds you well! I recently came across Nurture and was truly impressed by your innovative approach to helping young children develop essential life skills through engaging games and stories.

As you may know, we've been early investors in companies like GitHub, Figma, and Vercel. Your mission to create educational content designed by child development experts aligns perfectly with our vision of supporting impactful educational technology.

I was particularly intrigued by how Nurture has managed to blend play with learning for children aged 4-7, ensuring that educational effectiveness is at the forefront of your offerings. It's exciting to see how your work can shape the future of education for young learners.

A bit on Sound for context - we focus on investing in companies that are not only innovative but also have the potential to create a significant positive impact on society. We believe that education is foundational, and your work at Nurture resonates with that belief.

I would love to connect and explore potential synergies between Nurture and Sound Ventures. Would you be open to a brief call next week?

Looking forward to it,
